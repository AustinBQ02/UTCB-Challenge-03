# UTCB-Challenge-03: JavaScript - Password Generator
This is challenge 3 for the UT Coding Bootcamp (JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator).

> This module's Challenge requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected.   
>This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write.   
>It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Description

The goal of this project is to further my understanding of basic JavaScript by designing a password generator that meets specific criteria. (See User Stories and Acceptance Criteria in issues.)

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
